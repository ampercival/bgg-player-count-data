These are two scripts: one for collecting data from BGG, in particular, the player count information for games; the second is for visualizing these data in a filterable and sortable table.

# BoardGameGeek Player Count Data Script

This Python script fetches and processes board game data from BoardGameGeek (BGG), focusing on player count data and other relevant game details. It is designed to help users analyze game preferences based on player counts, ratings, and ownership.

## Features

- Fetch game data using BoardGameGeek's API.
- Process and analyze data based on player counts, ratings, and ownership.
- Output the processed data to a CSV file for easy analysis and sharing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- External libraries: requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml, fake_useragent, tqdm

## Usage

The script can be run with custom parameters via command-line arguments. Below are the available options:

- `-u`, `--username`: Specify the BoardGameGeek username to fetch games for. Default is `Percy0715`.
- `-f`, `--fetch`: Number of games to fetch. Default is `1000`.
- `-o`, `--output`: Filename for the output CSV. Default is `PlayerCountDataList.csv`.
- `-b`, `--batch_size`: Batch size for processing games. Default is `500`.

Use the CSV file to integrate with the associated data viewer.

### Running the Script

To run the script with default parameters, simply execute:

python BGG_PlayerCountData.py

To customize parameters, include them like so:

python BGG_PlayerCountData.py --username YourUsername --fetch 5000 --output custom_output.csv --batch_size 100

# Data Viewer for BoardGameGeek Player Count Data

In addition to the data collection script, there is a Python script for visualizing the fetched data in a filterable and sortable table. The viewer is built using PyQt5, allowing for dynamic data interaction.

## Features

- Visual representation of board game data in a table format.
- Filters to refine data view by various criteria, such as player count, game type, ownership, and more.
- Sortable columns to organize data based on factors like average rating, weight, and custom score factors.
- Integration with the CSV file generated by the BoardGameGeek Player Count Data Script for seamless data loading.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5: For the GUI components. Install it using pip:

## Usage
After generating the PlayerCountDataList.csv file using the BoardGameGeek Player Count Data Script, you can use this viewer to open and interact with the data:

Ensure the CSV file is in the same directory as the viewer script, or specify the path to the file when loading.

Run the viewer script:

python DataViewer.py

Use the filters and sorting features within the GUI to explore the board game data.

## Customizing the Viewer
The script includes parameters for adjusting the visualization and filtering logic, which can be customized to fit specific needs.
Additional filters or data columns can be added by modifying the script, allowing for further personalization of the data analysis experience.
